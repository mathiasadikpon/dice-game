        Additional Challenges
        <ul>
          <li>
            Update the code to give the player a running count of how many gold
            coins they have won each time they roll a winning toss, instead of
            only at the end.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add another rule: If the player rolls a 4, then 1 coin is subtracted
            from the total before the next roll, only if they have more than 0
            coins
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
